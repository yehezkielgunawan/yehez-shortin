This is the first project that made using [Yehez Next Chakra Starter](https://yehez-nextchakra-starter.yehezgun.com/).

## What I'm use here?

- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for HTTP Request.
- [Formik](https://formik.org/) for Form Validation. I know it's too OP here, but I want to understand this library more, LOL.

## How to use it?

- It's basically like [Tinyurl](https://tinyurl.com) when you want to shorten a long url.
- Open [Yehez-shortin](https://link.yehezgun.com).
- Input the long url that you want to make it short. You also can set the custom alias if you want.
- Then click the submit button if you want to make it short. TADA....
